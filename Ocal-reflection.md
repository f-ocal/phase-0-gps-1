## What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

- git rebase
- commit messages

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

- git rebase
- commit messages
- git push & git pull
- merge conflict

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked her about some of the commands I wasn't sure about such as

git rebase ; how exactly it works? what is the process for using it?
git push origin master; when and how to use this command?
commit messages ; What is the suggested way of writing messages?

## What still confuses you about git?

I sometimes forget to pull the master before checking out a new branch. More practices with GitHub and terminal commands, I become more familiar with them.

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first experience of pairing in a GPS was great :smile: It was very productive GPS session. I found her very helpful and she answered all of my questions and explained them clearly.
